# Household Power Consumption Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains data and analysis related to household power consumption. The data includes measurements of power consumption over a period of time in a residential setting. Various analyses and visualizations are provided to explore trends, patterns, and insights into household energy usage.

## Data
The data used in this analysis is sourced from kaggle. It includes the following columns:
- Date: Date of the power consumption measurement.
- Time: Time of the power consumption measurement.
- Global_active_power: The total active power consumed by the household (kilowatts).
- Global_reactive_power: The total reactive power consumed by the household (kilowatts).
- Voltage: Voltage (volts).
- Global_intensity: Total current intensity (amps).
- Sub_metering_1: Energy consumed in the kitchen (watt-hours of active energy).
- Sub_metering_2: Energy consumed in the laundry room (watt-hours of active energy).
- Sub_metering_3: Energy consumed in climate control systems (watt-hours of active energy).

## Analysis
The analysis includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of power consumption, identify outliers, and explore correlations.
- Visualizations such as time series plots, histograms, and correlation matrices.
- Statistical analysis to identify peak usage periods, average consumption, etc.
